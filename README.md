This is past schoolwork I have done as a computer science student. This repo is far from exhaustive, as some of my programming assignments require dependencies or confidential datasets that I cannot share. I also used to have really bad file management, so all of the programming assignments I did in ARM assembly are impossible to find now and therefore aren't in this repo. There's also various group/club projects where I wasn't the sole contributor, so I would feel bad about putting them on my own personal repo.
