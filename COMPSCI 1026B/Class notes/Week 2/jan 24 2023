# INPUT AND OUTPUT

#fname="Adam"
#lname="Smith"
#print("hello %s %s" % (fname,lname,))  #%s means "take the specified variable and put it here"
#the s stands for string, and this function only works for strings

#now lets try adding age

# fname="Adam"
# lname="Smith"
# age=902
# #print("hello %s %s[%10d]" % (fname,lname,age))
# #this will make ten spaces before the d-value

# print("hello %s [%-15s][%-10d]" % (fname,lname,age))
# #this makes that number of spaces after the value

# # gpa=3.9
# # print("your gpa is [%10.3f]" % (gpa))
# # #the .3f means to put 3 decimal spots, and the 3 spots are included in the 10 digits
# # #the square brackets arent necessary, theryre just meant to show the spaces
# use command + / to make everything a comment

#      RELATIONAL OPERATIONS

# Some quick math notation:

# = becomes == in Python.
# >=
# <= the = sign always goes last
# != means is not equal



# Assignment "=" make something true. Equality "==" checks if something is true. Very different things.

# else:

#remember, it's all case-sensitive, so we convert the strings to lowercase when comparing them with ==
